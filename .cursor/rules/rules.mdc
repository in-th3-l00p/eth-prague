## Project: Propellant

### Overview
Propellant is a token launcher platform designed specifically for influencers and content creators across well-known platforms. It enables creators to launch their own custom tokens and build deeper engagement with their fan base.

Using Propellant, influencers can issue personal tokens that fans earn by engaging with their content â€” watching, liking, or sharing. These activities are verified using ZK-TLS proofs to ensure authenticity and privacy. Fans can trade these tokens for exclusive rewards, while early supporters and investors can back creators before they hit the mainstream.

The platform transforms fan interaction into a dynamic investment ecosystem. It empowers creators to grow sustainable communities and gives fans the chance to hold and gain "stock" in their favorite influencers.

**It's Simple. Secure. Social investing.**

### Problem Statement
Traditional fan engagement with creators lacks verifiable rewards and investment opportunities. Fans cannot directly benefit from supporting their favorite creators before they become mainstream. There's a need for a secure, accessible platform that transforms social interaction into meaningful economic participation.

### Proposed Solution
Propellant allows creators to launch personal tokens with custom earning and trading rules. Fan engagement across platforms is verified using ZK-TLS proofs, ensuring authentic interactions while maintaining privacy. The system supports both crypto-native and mainstream users through accessible onboarding. Early supporters can invest in creators' tokens, creating a social investment ecosystem where fans become stakeholders in their favorite influencers' success.

### Technical Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (ERC-20/OFT, attestation-based access, bonding), Cadence (Flow support)
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TLS proof processing, attestation relay)
- **Data Sources**: X (Twitter) for engagement; vLayer for attestations (e.g., Revolut)
- **Interoperability**: LayerZero for OFT cross-chain token standard
- **Storage**: IPFS for off-chain creator metadata

### Sponsor Integrations
- **vLayer**:
  - WebProofs: Browser-based ZK proofs for actions on X, such as likes and follows.
  - Banking Attestations: Enables fans to purchase creator tokens with proof of identity (e.g., Revolut) instead of on-chain crypto.
  - zkP2Bonding: Attestation-based token buying flow for walletless users.
  - Gating: Token minting and purchasing restricted to users with specific proofs (e.g., following a creator on X).
  - zkP2P Market: P2P orderbook trading with proof-based gating.
  - Teleport: Enforces custom access rules using NFT or token ownership from any chain.

- **LayerZero**:
  - All creator tokens are OFTs, enabling frictionless cross-chain transfers and future composability.

- **Flow**:
  - Token factory and creator logic deployed to Flow for easy integration with apps targeting mainstream users and consumer contexts.

### Impact
Propellant bridges real-world social interaction with verifiable, decentralized value transfer. It lowers onboarding friction for fans by removing the need for wallets or tokens upfront, while empowering creators with configurable, attestable economies.

### Future Plans
- Add more Web2 platforms beyond X
- Integrate fiat on-ramps tied to attestation frameworks
- Expand zkP2P market with social features and staking
- Develop creator analytics and fan engagement dashboards
- Explore DAO-based management for creator token governance
