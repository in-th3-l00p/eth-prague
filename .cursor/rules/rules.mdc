## Project: PropenenTLS

### Overview
PropenenTLS is a decentralized protocol for creators to launch personal tokens that fans can earn or purchase based on real engagement. Fan actions on X (e.g., likes, follows) are verified through ZK-TLS proofs in-browser and attested via vLayer. The system supports both crypto-native and non-crypto users through off-chain attestations, enabling a more accessible creator economy.

### Problem Statement
Engagement with creators on traditional platforms is not verifiable or rewarded. Web3 creator tools are often gated behind crypto onboarding, excluding non-technical or non-wallet users. There is a need for trustless engagement verification and broader accessibility.

### Proposed Solution
PropenenTLS allows creators to deploy cross-chain tokens and define custom gating and earning rules. Fan engagement on X is verified using ZK-TLS, then attested through vLayer. Fans can claim tokens for activity or purchase them without crypto, using banking-based attestations (e.g., Revolut). LayerZero ensures all tokens are OFTs, and Flow supports additional deployment.

### Technical Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (ERC-20/OFT, attestation-based access, bonding), Cadence (Flow support)
- **Frontend**: React + Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TLS proof processing, attestation relay)
- **Data Sources**: X (Twitter) for engagement; vLayer for attestations (e.g., Revolut)
- **Interoperability**: LayerZero for OFT cross-chain token standard
- **Storage**: IPFS for off-chain creator metadata

### Sponsor Integrations
- **vLayer**:
  - WebProofs: Browser-based ZK proofs for actions on X, such as likes and follows.
  - Banking Attestations: Enables fans to purchase creator tokens with proof of identity (e.g., Revolut) instead of on-chain crypto.
  - zkP2Bonding: Attestation-based token buying flow for walletless users.
  - Gating: Token minting and purchasing restricted to users with specific proofs (e.g., following a creator on X).
  - zkP2P Market: P2P orderbook trading with proof-based gating.
  - Teleport: Enforces custom access rules using NFT or token ownership from any chain.

- **LayerZero**:
  - All creator tokens are OFTs, enabling frictionless cross-chain transfers and future composability.

- **Flow**:
  - Token factory and creator logic deployed to Flow for easy integration with apps targeting mainstream users and consumer contexts.

### Impact
PropenenTLS bridges real-world social interaction with verifiable, decentralized value transfer. It lowers onboarding friction for fans by removing the need for wallets or tokens upfront, while empowering creators with configurable, attestable economies.

### Future Plans
- Add more Web2 platforms beyond X
- Integrate fiat on-ramps tied to attestation frameworks
- Expand zkP2P market with social features and staking
- Develop creator analytics and fan engagement dashboards
- Explore DAO-based management for creator token governance
